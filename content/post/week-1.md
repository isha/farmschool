Excited for week 1! Expecting rain so didn't want this to be my first solo drive (just got license for farming school), thanks to Luke for coming with me. Lots of layers - with this much build up you just know it was painfully cold...

Covering covid protocol, student handbook and course outline. Particularly excited about bees!!

- Intro to small scale agriculture
- Seeds and the variety! Like floret, row 7 etc.
- Politics of agricultural land in Richmond
- Literally unable to feel feet, the warmest spot was the port a potty
- Some work out - covering fields with tarp. Holding it in place with dug out soil or sand bags. Tarps are heavy! Glad that I've continued weight lifting throughout the entire pandemic.
