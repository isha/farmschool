Week 2! I'm better prepared for the cold but not so sure about the wind warning. At least I got my nifty toe warmers delivered in time and hopefully there will be no almost-frostbite this week. This was also the week for my first solo drive. I was very nervous but managed to make there alright. We started with the farm walk with Daniel where he pointed out the new buds on the fruit trees.

Continued to find rhubard planted in a circle around a tree. I thought it was quite artistic but Daniel seems to want to relocate the rhubarb to nice uniform rows later.

Our morning lesson today was Soil Sciences with Amy Norgard. I learned a lot of things in this lesson. Amidst those were:
- Dont call it dirt!
- Sand vs silt vs clay
- Einstein was a soil scientist
- How to repair your waterproof bibs

We also went outside to compare the soil structure in various parts of the farm.

The afternoon lessos was market crop planning with Kareno and Daniel. how to plan a CSA given land and desired $. Terminology like bed, row, in-row, on-row spacing, bed foot, etc.

By 3pm the weather was steadily getting worse. Now we had a downpour added on to the strong winds. Daniel put the outdoor work to a vote - almost unanimous vote to leave the student plot assignment for next week. I won't name who still wanted to do it in the rain!
